# noteoffs

Detect Note On events that are missing a corresponding Note Off event.

## Install

```
go get -u github..com/scgolang/noteoffs
```

## Why?

To figure out if my suspicion is true, that the [midi](https://github.com/scgolang/midi) package sometimes does not deliver Note Off messages on Mac.
